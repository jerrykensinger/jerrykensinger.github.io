  <p>
    I work in the IT distribution and partner ecosystem, helping resellers and
    customers align technology with business outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    My focus includes infrastructure, vendor programs, and long-term partner strategy—
    simplifying solutions and making projects easier to adopt and support.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m based in the U.S. and enjoy technology, family time, and staying on top of new
    platforms and devices.
